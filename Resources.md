## How to Study Mathematics

To study mathematics

## Books

Here are recommended books in different areas of interest.

### Toy Books
[Visual Complex Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Complex-Analysis-Tristan-Needham/dp/0198534469 "Visual Complex Analysis") - Teaches complex analysis through geometric intuition.

[Visual Group Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Group-Theory-Problem-Book/dp/088385757X "Visual Group Theory") - Teaches group theory through intuition.

[Logicomix](https://www.amazon.com/Logicomix-search-truth-Apostolos-Doxiadis/dp/1596914521 "Logicomix") - A comic which goes through some of the foundational issues in mathematics.

[Elliptic Tales: Curves, Counting, and Number Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Elliptic-Tales-Curves-Counting-Number/dp/0691151199 "Elliptic Tales: Curves, Counting, and Number Theory") - Gives a really nice introduction to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, which is one of the *Millennium Prize Problems*.

## Articles

Articles which I consider worth reading.

### Homotopy Theory

[The First Stable Homotopy Groups of Motivic Spheres](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00365.pdf "The First Stable Homotopy Groups of Motivic Spheres") - Studies stable motivic homotopy groups of motivic spheres. They are using the slice spectral sequence.

[Algebraic Cobordism and Étale Cohomology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06258.pdf "Algebraic Cobordism and Étale Cohomology") - Studies connections between algebraic cobordism and étale cohomology.

## Blogs
